### Usage
* You can replay/record movies by pressing the corresponding hotkeys (Control+R and Control+N by default). There are also hotkeys for stopping a movie (Control+T by default) and for playing the active movie from the beginning (Shift+R by default).
* You can toggle movie read-only/read+write mode (Control+Q by default).
* You can use RAM Search and RAM Watch by pressing the corresponding hotkeys (Control+F and Control+W by default).
* You can open the Lua console by pressing the corresponding hotkeys (Control+L by default) or with the command line parameter "-lua" (example: mame.exe cninja -lua example.lua).
* AVI (uncomressed) can be recorded from the movie using the command: mame-rr romname -pb moviename.mar -aviwrite aviname.avi. To stop recording, just close the emulator.
* If movie recording was started while paused, the replay dialog should also be opened while paused.
* If the state was saved while paused, it should also be loaded while paused.
