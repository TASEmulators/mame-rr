    speaker.c

    Sound driver to emulate a simple speaker,
    driven by one or more output bits

/* Discussion of oversampling and anti-alias filtering: (Anders Hallstr?m)
 *
 * This driver is for machines that directly control
 * one or more simple digital-to-analog converters (DAC)
 * connected to one or more audio outputs (such as analog amp + speaker).
 * Currently only 1-bit DAC is supported via the interface to this module.
 *
 * Frequently such machines would oversample the DAC
 * in order to overcome the limited DAC resolution.
 * For faithful reproduction of the sound, this must be carefully handled
 * with anti-alias filtering when converting a high-rate low-resolution signal
 * to a moderate-rate high-resolution signal suitable for the DAC in the emulator's sound card.
 * (Originally, removal of any redundant high frequency content occured on the analog side
 *  with no aliasing effects.)
 *
 * The most straightforward, naive way to handle this is to use two streams;
 * stream 1 modeling the native audio, with a sampling rate that allows for
 * accurate representation of over-sampling, i.e. the sampling rate should match
 * the clock frequency of the audio generating device (such as the CPU).
 * Stream 1 is connected to stream 2, which is concerned with feeding the sound card.
 * The stream system has features to handle rate conversion from stream 1 to 2.
 *
 * I tried it out of curiosity; it works fine conceptually, but
 *  - it puts an unneccessary burden on system resources
 *  - sound quality is still not satisfactory, though better than without anti-alias
 *  - "stream 1" properties are machine specific and so should be configured
 *    individually in each machine driver using this approach.
 *    This can also be seen as an advantage for flexibility, though.
 *
 * Instead, dedicated filtering is implemented in this module,
 * in a machine-neutral way (based on machine time and external -samplerate only).
 *
 * The basic average filter has the advantage that it can be used without
 * explicitly generating all samples in "stream 1". However,
 * it is poor for anti-alias filtering.
 * Therefore, average filtering is combined with windowed sinc.
 *
 * Virtual stream 1: Samples in true machine time.
 * Any sampling rate up to attotime resolution is implicitly supported.
 * -> average filtering over each stream 2 sample ->
 * Virtual stream 2: Intermediate representation.
 * Sample rate = RATE_MULTIPLIER * stream 3 sample rate.
 * If effective rate of stream 1 exceeds rate of stream 2,
 * some aliasing distorsion is introduced in this step because the average filtering is a compromise.
 * The distorsion is however mostly in the higher frequencies.
 * -> low-pass anti-alias filtering with kernel ampl[] ->
 * -> down-sampling ->
 * Actual stream 3: channel output generated by speaker_sound_update().
 * Sample rate = device sample rate = configured "-samplerate".
 *
 * In the speaker_state data structure,
 *    "intermediate samples" refers to "stream 2"
 *    "channel samples" refers to "stream 3"
 */

/* IMPROVEMENTS POSSIBLE:
 * - Make filter length a run-time configurable parameter. min=1 max=1000 or something
 * - Optimize cutoff freq automatically after filter length, or configurable too
 * - Generalise this approach to other DAC-based sound types if susceptible to aliasing
